    	<p>"Craig De Lorenzo's performance as Ken is solid, and as a performer he
connects emotionally with the text and the audience at several key
moments... De Lorenzo performs Ken's two major moments with passion
and immediacy, but the playwright has let him down somewhat."</p>
    	<p>-<strong>Chad Nance</strong>, <em>Camel City Dispatch, Winston Salem's Online News Daily</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
    	<p> "As Ken, De Lorenzo mastered the challenging feat of being submissive
    	  onstage without once making the character small. His fresh energy was
    	  the ideal juxtaposition to the aging stubbornness of the Rothko
    	  character. There was an apparent maturing as the play ensues, with De
    	  Lorenzo locking into the emotional build. Therefore, in climatic
    	  moments, he was convincingly able to stand his ground with affective
    	  potency."</p>

<h3>VISITING MR. GREEN </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;And this is where the beautifully human performances of Robert Grossman and Craig De Lorenzo come in…De Lorenzo invests Ross with a disarming, boyish charm that nevertheless hints at some gnawing unease. When the character is finally inspired to anger, he comes off as passionate but not screechy.&quot;<br>
    <br>

    <blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The genius of De Lorenzo&rsquo;s performance is in how he gradually peels away the outer layers of his character to reveal the damaged and dejected lost soul that lies underneath it all. His fully realized, completely exposed emotional eruptions in the second act are wholly felt and incredibly affecting.&quot;<br>

    <blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Craig De Lorenzo&rsquo;s resume includes &ldquo;My Name is Asher Lev,&rdquo; &ldquo;Amadeus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brighton Beach Memoirs&rdquo; and more. Williams worked with De Lorenzo in &ldquo;Asher Lev.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an incredibly gifted young actor, and it&rsquo;s wonderful to watch him work,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s full of a brightness, energy and vitality that allow him to approach his character from an amazingly introspective place. Both of these two actors are really from different places – much like their characters. They work so well together and have great instincts. That makes the director&rsquo;s job much easier when the actors come in with all these gifts.&rdquo;<br>

    <h3>MY NAME IS ASHER LEV</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Kudos to De Lorenzo, who as Asher holds the stage easily and with great assurance.&quot;<br>

      <p>&quot;Craig De Lorenzo gives an outstanding performance as Asher Lev.&quot; <br>

        <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;De Lorenzo gives his speeches emotional depth in 'My Name is Asher Lev'.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        -<strong>Jeff Smith</strong>, <em>The San Diego Reader </em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;De Lorenzo is utterly natural, completely at ease, with nothing of 'the actor' about him. His eyes are as articulate as his voice. This is an immaculate, affecting performance to cherish.&quot;<br>
